many thanks

I have made the PCB and tested it, every thing is good except 

* some capacitors' footprint is not right(but I bend the leg....lol)

* pin3 and pin6 for IC1 should swap


now in this commit, I have update the arduino program. it works fine...more testing needed


all down, good night!
